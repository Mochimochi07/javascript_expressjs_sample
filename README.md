# javascript_expressjs_sample

this is my express js sample code.

its about yugioh and tokens.

i always wanted to learn auth because its kinda hard to learn authentication in golang when i dont really know how those authrorizations used in api tools.

i didnt learn much of those things because i cant understand how i could go logging in.

this is only meant for learning purposes because its kinda hard to learn much of this.

i will be telling you that this is not much complete because i was planning of making a database with only JSON and express.


the steps are just simple.


view cards= 
you need to post in bearer tokens in /tokens as a client

you insert the token value generated in header at custom.

you neet to get as a request in /cards as a client

all the cards are shown.



login as admin= 

you need to post admin and pass in the /admin/login as admin

you insert the token generated in header at custom 

you go edit the cards 

send post in /cards with the admin token generated.



after you updated the cards in /cards

you get another token as a client in /tokens

and view it again in /cards.
